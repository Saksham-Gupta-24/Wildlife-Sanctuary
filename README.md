# Wildlife-Sanctuary
This Project stores the information of plants and animals species of the wildlife  sanctuary, it also stores the feeding items of the animals. This project can also store the details of the visitors of the  wildlife sanctuary. This project is completely implemented using Data Structure in C language.


# Mini Project Using Data structures in C
## The title of the project is "Wild Sanctuary".

WILDLIFE SANCTUARY is a place where plants and animals species are protected. 
Where they can live safely. They will get the proper environment to live there. They will 
get the proper food, water, shelter, etc. And where their proper care has been taken. 

A few years ago, there were very few wildlife sanctuaries. But now more and more wildlife 
sanctuaries are being created, which is a very good thing. In previous time, people uses books 
and registers for writing the record which is very hardworking and consumes too much time. 
But now everything has changed, people use various new methods to do there to work in 
an easy way, which also reduces their time wastage. So, in order to overcome all these 
problems, we can use this project. 

This project is for those students who wants to learn how to record the data in the system 
using c language and it would be helpful for those who are managing the record of the 
Wildlife Sanctuaries. 

This project is having a menu-based structure in which it is having certain options for 
managing the data like users can store the record of new plants and animals species, 
visitors of their wildlife Sanctuary and they can store the feeding items of the animals. 
This project is completely implemented using DATA STRUCTURE IN C Programming 
Language. This project is very easy to understand. This whole project is made using Turbo 
C/C++ software.

## Methodology

Here in this project I have used the concept of the linked list [ single linked list ]. With 
the help of a linked list in this project, user can store the details of species [plants and 
animals] and visitors. 

With the help of a linked list in this project user can also store the feeding items of the 
animals. 

I also have used the concept of arrays which is used to store the names and basic details 
of species and the visitors. And which also helps the user to store the feeding items 
name. 


## Data Structures Used

* LINKED LISTS:

Linked list is a dynamic data structure. In the linked list data items are not in a sequential 
manner. we can also call linked list as linear data structure because of its appearance 
that is linked is a collection of items where each node contains data and a pointer (or) 
link to the next item.

In the linked list elements are usually stored in random memory locations with the help 
of pointers. It is having nodes in which each node has a data part and a pointer part of 
the next node. The data part contains the value of the node and the reference part 
contains the address of the next node. 

* SINGLY LINKED LIST:

single linked list is a collection of nodes in which each node has two-part:

i.First part is having data.

ii. Second part having Pointer- which links or holds the address of the next node.

II. The first node’s address is stored in ‘Head’ which is known as start and the last node 
pointer part contains “NULL” value.

* ARRAYS:

i. An array is a collection of data of a similar datatype.

ii. Elements in an array can be accessed using an index.

iii. Arrays can be of fixed size, making them a static data type.

iv. Array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. 

v. The first element of an array is stored at the lowest memory address, while the last element is stored at the highest memory address.

vi. Syntax- Data-type Array-Name[index];

## Software Requirements:

1. TURBO C/C++
2. DEV C++
3. VISUAL STUDIO CODE [ IDE ]
Etc. and other IDEs we can use.
